# Standard-Korean-Dictionary
This repo contains Universal Windows Platform (UWP) App that can connect to the Standard Korean dictionary and search and output the results. These code were created with the Universal Windows Platform templates available in Visual Studio, and are designed to run on Windows 10(Build 16299 or later) desktop, that support the Universal Windows Platform. I plan to port to a headless browser like PhantomJS.

## Universal Windows Platform development
These samples require Visual Studio 2017 or higher and the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 16299 for Windows 10.
